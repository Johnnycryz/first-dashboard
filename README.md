# first-dashboard
I downloaded the excel data from Kaggle.com as a csv file
I did basic cleaning of the file:
-  Change date type
-  Remove duplicates
-  Remove blank spaces
I also add few columns needed for analysis to the data.
Conducted analysis as needed
After the analysis of the data, created five pivot charts
Then used the pivot charts to create a dashboard
I also add slicer to some of the pivot tables.

 
Shortcomings:
There are some things I would like to do on the dashboard, but currently I don't know how to do:
Adding a slicer to the pivot tables and giving accurate output on the KPI when filters are attached.
