# first-dashboard
I downloaded the excel data from Kaggle.com as a csv file
I did basic cleaning of the file:
-  Change date type
-  Remove duplicates
-  Remove blank spaces
I also add few columns needed for analysis to the data.
Conducted analysis as needed
After the analysis of the data, created five pivot charts
Then used the pivot charts to create a dashboard
